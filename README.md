## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

The version of this branch is version 1.0.

This project is based on a traditional Spanish card game called Cinquillo. It is played with the Spanish deck of cards, but I have used the French deck.In this game all the cards in the deck are dealt and the winner is the first player to get rid of all the cards. Traditionally the player with the 5 of golds starts, but by using the French deck I have decided that the player who starts is random. The idea is to use the 5 of each suit and then complete the suit by putting cards with consecutive numbers.

In other words. One player puts the 5 of clubs on the table. The next player could use another 5, or the 4 or 6 of clubs if they have them.

## About the development and improvements

This project has several similarities with the Keypad puzzle. All the game logic is contained in a single script called GameManager, and an auxiliary script is used to store the card values called PlayerCard.

This project has several problems that can be summed up in one. Dynamism. What if I wanted to expand the game for several players?
