## About me

Hi! I write games and I like it! I'm Alex and welcome to my Github! I'm Gamedev and Gamedesigner and I upload my projects to Github to share them and discuss how they are programmed, which you will find later in this archive.

The reason is that I like my public repositories to be educational first and foremost. In the README you will find hints on how to improve the code!

If you like what I do, please follow me on my social networks!

## About the project

The version of this branch is version 2.0.

This project is based on a traditional Spanish card game called Cinquillo. It is played with the Spanish deck of cards, but I have used the French deck.In this game all the cards in the deck are dealt and the winner is the first player to get rid of all the cards. Traditionally the player with the 5 of golds starts, but by using the French deck I have decided that the player who starts is random. The idea is to use the 5 of each suit and then complete the suit by putting cards with consecutive numbers.

In other words. One player puts the 5 of clubs on the table. The next player could use another 5, or the 4 or 6 of clubs if they have them.

In this version a player can play against 1 or several AIs up to a limit of 5 AIs.

There is also a mode where the AI plays against itself.

## About the development and improvements

In the README of version 1.0 it said that the problem of this game was the dynamism. In this version that problem has disappeared. The game has now been changed so that you can play against multiple AIs, giving the game more variety.

In addition, a mode against AIs only has been created. I find this mode interesting because with it you can create statistical models.

In this version the code has improved but I find two problems to fix. The positioning of the player and AI cards and the refactoring of the PlayerController script.

In a version 3 my idea was to fix those problems and also a problem concerning the UI. Why not allow the player to double click to use the cards, could the Reset and Main Menu buttons be hidden?

For version 4 I wanted to talk about AI. Actually in this project there is no AI. But is it possible to improve this loop given the game mechanics to make it as difficult or easy as possible?

But due to Unity's policy changes I've decided that I'm going to start with Unreal Engine projects due to lack of time.
